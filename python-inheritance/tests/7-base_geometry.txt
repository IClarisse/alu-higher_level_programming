# Test 1: Valid integer validation

width = 89
# Expected: No exceptions should be raised

# Test 2: Invalid value (string instead of integer)
name = "John"
# Expected: TypeError exception should be raised with message "name must be an integer"

# Test 3: Invalid value (value is 0)
age = 0
# Expected: ValueError exception should be raised with message "age must be greater than 0"

# Test 4: Invalid value (negative value)
distance = -4
# Expected: ValueError exception should be raised with message "distance must be greater than 0"
